<summary>Abstract</summary>
Kuzushiji, a pre-modern Japanese cursive script, can currently be read and understood by only a few thousand trained experts in Japan. With the rapid development of deep learning, researchers have begun applying Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to transcribe Kuzushiji into modern Japanese. Although existing OCR methods perform well on clean pre-modern Japanese documents written in Kuzushiji, they often fail to consider various types of noise, such as document degradation and seals, which significantly affect recognition accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset specifically addresses these challenges. To address this gap, we introduce the Degraded Kuzushiji Documents with Seals (DKDS) dataset as a new benchmark for related tasks. We describe the dataset construction process, which required the assistance of a trained Kuzushiji expert, and define two benchmark tracks: (1) text and seal detection and (2) document binarization. For the text and seal detection track, we provide baseline results using multiple versions of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) models for detecting Kuzushiji characters and seals. For the document binarization track, we present baseline results from traditional binarization algorithms, traditional algorithms combined with K-means clustering, and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)–based methods.

[ToonifyGB: StyleGAN-based Gaussian Blendshapes for 3D Stylized Head Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10072) \\

[Project](https://ruiyangju.github.io/ToonifyGB)｜[GitHub](https://github.com/RuiyangJu/ToonifyGB)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
The introduction of 3D Gaussian blendshapes has enabled the real-time reconstruction of animatable head avatars from monocular video. Toonify, a StyleGAN-based framework, has become widely used for facial image stylization. To extend Toonify for synthesizing diverse stylized 3D head avatars using Gaussian blendshapes, we propose an efficient two-stage framework, ToonifyGB. In Stage 1 (stylized video generation), we employ an improved StyleGAN to generate the stylized video from the input video frames, which addresses the limitation of cropping aligned faces at a fixed resolution as preprocessing for normal StyleGAN. This process provides a more stable video, which enables Gaussian blendshapes to better capture the high-frequency details of the video frames, and efficiently generate high-quality animation in the next stage. In Stage 2 (Gaussian blendshapes synthesis), we learn a stylized neutral head model and a set of expression blendshapes from the generated video. By combining the neutral head model with expression blendshapes, ToonifyGB can efficiently render stylized avatars with arbitrary expressions. We validate the effectiveness of ToonifyGB on the benchmark dataset using two styles: Arcane and Pixar.

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Document image enhancement and binarization are commonly performed before document analysis and recognition tasks to improve the efficiency and accuracy of techniques such as optical character recognition (OCR). This is because directly recognizing text in degraded documents, particularly in color images, often obtains unsatisfactory results. Training independent generative adversarial networks (GANs) for each color channel can generate images where shadows and noise are effectively removed, which in turn facilitates efficient text information extraction. However, employing multiple GANs for different color channels requires long training and inference times. To reduce both training and inference times of models for document image enhancement and binarization, we propose MFE-GAN, an efficient GAN-based framework with multi-scale feature extraction (MFE), which incorporates Haar wavelet transformation (HWT) and normalization to process document images before feeding them into GANs for training. In addition, we present novel generators, discriminators, and loss functions to improve the model's performance, and conduct ablation studies to demonstrate their effectiveness. Experimental results on the Benchmark, Nabuco, and CMATERdb datasets show that the proposed MFE-GAN significantly reduces both the total training and inference times while maintaining comparable performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.

[Fracture Detection in Pediatric Wrist Trauma X-ray Images Using YOLOv8 Algorithm](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-47460-7) \\

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Hospital emergency departments frequently receive lots of bone fracture cases, with pediatric wrist trauma fracture accounting for the majority of them. Before pediatric surgeons perform surgery, they need to ask patients how the fracture occurred and analyze the fracture situation by interpreting X-ray images. The interpretation of X-ray images often requires a combination of techniques from radiologists and surgeons, which requires time-consuming specialized training. With the rise of deep learning in the field of computer vision, network models applying for fracture detection has become an important research topic. In this paper, we use data augmentation to improve the model performance of YOLOv8 algorithm (the latest version of You Only Look Once) on a pediatric wrist trauma X-ray dataset (GRAZPEDWRI-DX), which is a public dataset. The experimental results show that our model has reached the state-of-the-art (SOTA) mean average precision (mAP 50). Specifically, mAP 50 of our model is 0.638, which is significantly higher than the 0.634 and 0.636 of the improved YOLOv7 and original YOLOv8 models. To enable surgeons to use our model for fracture detection on pediatric wrist trauma X-ray images, we have designed the application “Fracture Detection Using YOLOv8 App” to assist surgeons in diagnosing fractures, reducing the probability of error analysis, and providing more useful information for surgery.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
Deep visual odometry, despite extensive research, still faces limitations in accuracy and generalizability that prevent its broader application. To address these challenges, we propose an Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)-guided visual odometry with selective online adaptation named ORB-SfMLearner. We present a novel use of ORB features for learning-based ego-motion estimation, leading to more robust and accurate results. We also introduce the cross-attention mechanism to enhance the explainability of PoseNet and have revealed that driving direction of the vehicle can be explained through the attention weights. To improve generalizability, our selective online adaptation allows the network to rapidly and selectively adjust to the optimal parameters across different domains. Experimental results on KITTI and vKITTI datasets show that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art deep visual odometry methods in terms of ego-motion accuracy and generalizability.

[Resolution enhancement processing on low quality images using swin transformer based on interval dense connection strategy](https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-023-16088-0) \\
**Rui-Yang Ju**, Chih-Chia Chen, Jen-Shiun Chiang, Yu-Shian Lin, Wei-Han Chen, Chun-Tse Chien \\
[GitHub](https://github.com/Rubbbbbbbbby/SwinOIR)
<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
The Transformer-based method has demonstrated remarkable performance for image super-resolution in comparison to the method based on the convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, using the self-attention mechanism like SwinIR (Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer) to extract feature information from images needs a significant amount of computational resources, which limits its application on low computing power platforms. To improve the model feature reuse, this research work proposes the Interval Dense Connection Strategy, which connects different blocks according to the newly designed algorithm. We apply this strategy to SwinIR and present a new model, which named SwinOIR (Object Image Restoration Using Swin Transformer). For image super-resolution, an ablation study is conducted to demonstrate the positive effect of the Interval Dense Connection Strategy on the model performance. Furthermore, we evaluate our model on various popular benchmark datasets, and compare it with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) lightweight models. For example, SwinOIR obtains a PSNR of 26.62 dB for x4 upscaling image super-resolution on Urban100 dataset, which is 0.15 dB higher than the SOTA model SwinIR. For real-life application, this work applies the lastest version of You Only Look Once (YOLOv8) model and the proposed model to perform object detection and real-life image super-resolution on low-quality images.
